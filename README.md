### About me ⚡

I am a PhD student in Physics at the Instituto de Física Teórica of UNESP (IFT-UNESP), in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I also hold a BSc and Msc in Physics from Instituto Balseiro, in Argentina. My current PhD research mathematical modeling of infectious diseases - more specifically arboviruses (dengue/chikungunya) and measles - using data analysis, mechanistic models and machine learning. I am particularly interested in climate and susceptibility heterogeneities and their impacts on epidemic dynamics. Furthermore, I also have experience in developing data-driven solutions for epidemiological surveillance of measles and SARI, such as data analysis, dashboards, reports and risk estimation tools. You can find me here on Github sharing code and data for my research work, as well as personal, free-time coding projects, portfolio and visualizations.

👧 I am a PhD student in Physics at IFT (Institute of Theoretical Physics) of the UNESP University in Sao Paulo, Brazil. My PhD research encompasses epidemic modeling of diseases, focusing on measles and arboviral diseases like dengue and chikungunya. My main research interests include are in mathematical epidemiology using tools like dynamical systems, public epidemic data and machine learning. I hold a MSc and BSc in Physics from Instituto Balseiro, from Argentina. Throughout my MSc research, I studied the spread of COVID-19 in Argentina using publicly available datasets. 

💻 I am most proficient in Python, R and C/C++ programming languages. Additionally, I have knowledge of SQL and basic HTML.

⚛️ I have skills in mathematical modeling, statistics, programming, data science, machine learning and deep learning acquired by my training as a physicist and as a researcher, as well as self-study. 

🔭 I am interested in learning more about statistical inference and NPL. 

🌱 I am currently learning problabilistic programming for bayesian statistical inference. 

⚡ I am also very interested in human languages, including Spanish (native), English (proficient), Portuguese (proficient) and French (intermediate).
