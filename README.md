👧 I am a PhD student in Physics at IFT (Institute of Theoretical Physics) of the UNESP University in Sao Paulo, Brazil. My PhD research encompasses epidemic modeling of diseases, focusing on measles and arboviral diseases like dengue and chikungunya. My main research interests include are in mathematical epidemiology using tools like dynamical systems, public epidemic data and machine learning. I hold a MSc and BSc in Physics from Instituto Balseiro, from Argentina. Throughout my MSc research, I studied the spread of COVID-19 in Argentina using publicly available datasets. 

💻 I am most proficient in Python, R and C/C++ programming languages. Additionally, I have knowledge of SQL and basic HTML.

⚛️ I have skills in mathematical modeling, statistics, programming, data science, machine learning and deep learning acquired by my training as a physicist and as a researcher, as well as self-study. 

🔭 I am interested in learning more about statistical inference and NPL. 

🌱 I am currently learning problabilistic programming for bayesian statistical inference. 

⚡ I am also very interested in human languages, including Spanish (native), English (proficient), Portuguese (proficient) and French (intermediate).
